REQ-39 is only evidenced as updated in the HomePage “Why Choose Us” section; the diff does not provide evidence that the word “delivery” was removed from all user-facing frontend copy site-wide.",

      "reason": "The diff shows a copy change on the homepage, but does not show (or summarize) changes across the rest of the frontend to ensure there are no remaining occurrences of \"delivery\" (case-insensitive) anywhere user-facing.",
