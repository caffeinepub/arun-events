# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the homepage banner carousel autoplay by default and update site copy to remove “delivery” wording so it reads like a service website.

**Planned changes:**
- Enable banner carousel auto-sliding on the homepage when 2+ banner images are configured, while preserving existing pause-on-interaction and manual navigation behavior.
- Replace all user-facing uses of the word “delivery” with service-appropriate English wording (e.g., “on-time service” / “on-time setup”) across the frontend.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage banner rotates automatically (when multiple banners exist) and all website text reads as a service offering (no “delivery” wording remains).
